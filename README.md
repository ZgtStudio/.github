# Zgt Studio

Small independent lab focused on **AI**, **computer vision** and **intelligent systems**.

Zgt Studio experiments with:

- computer vision & image processing (Python, OpenCV, deep learning),
- health-oriented and education-oriented AI tools,
- learning systems that adapt to the user’s mistakes and progress.

## Focus areas

- **Plant & crop health AI**  
  Image-based detection of plant diseases, leaf defects and stress symptoms using computer vision and deep learning.

- **Smart agriculture & field analytics**  
  Tools that process images and sensor data from fields, greenhouses or drones to support decisions such as irrigation, fertilization and yield estimation.

- **Learning & decision-support systems for growers**  
  Interactive tools, adaptive quizzes and assistants that teach farmers and students how to diagnose problems and choose the right actions.


## Early projects

- 🔹 **Adaptive Quiz Engine** – Python-based quiz system that adjusts questions based on user performance.  
- 🔹 **Vision Lab (WIP)** – A set of small, focused experiments in classical computer vision.  
- 🔹 **Health AI Assistant (Planned)** – Symptom-driven assistant for basic triage and guidance.

More projects and experiments will be added as the studio grows.
